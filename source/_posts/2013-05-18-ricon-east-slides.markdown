I spoke at [Ricon East 2013](http://ricon.io/east.html).  I had to
follow the keynote given by Dr. Margo Seltzer - a tough act to
follow. Here are my slides:

**Note:** Some interpretted my "playful jabbing" of MongoDB as
  bashing. That was not my intent. At $DAYJOB, we've had some good and
  some not so good expiriences with it. Unfortunantly, a couple of the
  "not so good experiences" were down right horrible and were on
  fairly high profile projects. After much consternation, those
  projects are now stable, but given those experiences, we felt that
  MongoDB was definitely not a fit for the project I was describing. I
  really did not want to get into the _Riak vs MongoDB_ debate during
  my talk.

**Another Note:** We did look at Cassandra. At the time I felt it did
  not meet our goal of "operational simplicity." Another group at
  $DAYJOB has successfully deployed it for a different project, so I
  will be looking at in in more depth.

The following is me playing with twitter widgets:
